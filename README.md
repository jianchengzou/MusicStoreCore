# MusicStoreCore
An exercise to migrate Music Store tutorial app to ASP.NET Core 1.1

The solution was created on Visual Studio 2017. It utilises ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core and a little bit jQuery.
From the exercise, I found ASP.NET middleware, authentication and authorization are interesting and fun to learn on.
