# MusicStoreCore
An exercise to migrate Music Store tutorial app to ASP.NET Core 1.1

When I started to learn ASP.NET before from original Music Store tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/), I found it is hard as newer Visual Studio 2013+ IDE doesn't support ASP.NET MVC 3 anymore. 

In my process pf learning new technology. I start to rewrite Music Store on ASP.NET Core and which helps me understand better on tutorial and book. The uploaded solution is created on Visual Studio 2017. It utilises ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core and some simple jQuery and CSS.

From the exercise, I find ASP.NET middleware, authentication and authorization are fun to learn.
